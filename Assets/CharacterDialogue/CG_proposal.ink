Hey, I saw you talk to that one guy. Is he looking for something?

* [Yeah, a car key. Why?] -> B
* [Why do you ask?] -> B 

== B ==
Well, after he ran through and came back to talk with us, I noticed his car key fell off his carabiner. I'd like you to do something for me.

* [Alright, what?] -> C

== C == 
Talk him into covering the paperwork damages. Right now, my boss is forcing me to, and I think it's ridiculous. If you do, I'll give the car key. 

* [I'll think about it.] -> END
